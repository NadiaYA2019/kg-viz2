> Providing visualisations on top of the WeKG-MF RDF dataset


Abstract
--------

The recent trend of adopting linked-data principles to integrate and
publish semantically described open data using W3C standards has led
to a large amount of available resources. In particular,
meteorological sensor data have been uplifted into public
weather-focused RDF graphs, such as WeKG-MF which offers access to a
large set of meteorological variables described through spatial and
temporal dimensions. Nevertheless, these resources include huge
numbers of raw observations that are tedious to explore by lay
users. Here, we aim at providing them with visual exploratory "tours",
benefiting from RDF data cubes to present high-level aggregated views
together with on-demand fine-grained details through a unified Web
interface.


Online demonstrator
-------------------

An online demonstrator of the interface is available at
<https://nadiaya2019.github.io/DemoKGViz/>.


Repository files
----------------

This repository contains:

- `README.md` (this file): providing documentation;
- `index.html`: the interface Web page, allowing to explore the WeKG-MF SPARQL endpoint visually;
- `css/`: contains the style files;
- `js/`: gathers JavaScript libraries;
- `LICENSE.md`.
