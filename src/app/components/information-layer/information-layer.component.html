        The recent trend of adopting linked-data principles to integrate and
        publish semantically described open data using W3C standards has led to a
        large amount of available resources. In particular, meteorological sensor
        data have been uplifted into public weather-focused RDF graphs, such as
        WeKG-MF which offers access to a large set of meteorological variables
        described through spatial and temporal dimensions. Nevertheless, these
        resources include huge numbers of raw observations that are tedious to
        explore by lay users. In this article, we aim at providing them with
        visual exploratory "tours", benefiting from RDF data cubes to present
        high-level aggregated views together with on-demand fine-grained details
        through a unified Web interface.'
